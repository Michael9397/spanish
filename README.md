## Spanish Practice

I'm not a fluent spanish speaker.  I'm a developer trying to learn spanish.  I'm building the things that I want to practice and get better.  So I'm building it as a Laravel SPA with Inertia and Vue.  If you want, fork it change it, have a great time.

I'm going to build things to help me remember and learn the various things from the videos I watch.  I've started with the conjugations.  I made it where I can practice a verb and run it through all the parts I care about.  Then I made it where I can I practice multiple verbs at once.

- Conjugate 1 verb through all the conjugations.
- Conjugate Multiple verbs through a selectable verb tense.


## Future Plans

I want to do more of a flash card view for the conjugations to where I have to recall a certain word from the conjugations.  For instance, I talked = habl√©.  I also want to be able to start from English or Spanish.  

## Contributing

If you want to contribute code to the project for whatever reason, submit an issue before you do the work.  I'm going to be particular about what I want to include.
